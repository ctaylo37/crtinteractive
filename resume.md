					<li>Designers and planners around the world help shape the future of sustainable communities on a daily basis. We take many factors into account when forming our decisions around designing communities, including geospatial, socio-economic, and environmental conditions. Much of this data is accessible via “open data” policies and platforms such as Open Data Philly, but as designers we need a way to access this data in a format that is easy to use and analyze. This is where open source web applications like OpenTreeMap are born.</li>
					<li>Open Source Applications are the future of Philly. By creating more accessible, open tools like OTM, we can put information in the hands of both citizens and decision makers to create a more vibrant, sustainable Philadelphia.</li>
